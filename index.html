      What is a blog niche?
    </h2>
    <p>
      A blog niche is a specialized topic area that you'll be focusing on when writing content. Blogging niches allow you to narrow down your audience and craft content that is much more relevant for them.

    <p>
      As a result, readers are more likely to become blog subscribers and you'll be able to build authority and position yourself as a thought leader. Plus, you'll be making it much easier for search engines to identify what your blog is about and increase your chances of ranking on high positions, which in turn will bring even more readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many types of blogs you can choose to focus on, ranging from the highly technical to the more personal or creative. Some of the most common ways of brainstorming blog niche ideas include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">Industry based</span>, such as a cryptocurrency or freelancing.</li>
      <li><span  class="bold">Audience based</span>, by targeting audiences like small business owners or newlyweds.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Subject based</span>, like news content and movie reviews.</li>
    </ul>

      How to find your blogging niche
    </h2>
    <p>
      As you learn how to start a blog, choosing the right niche is crucial for building a strong foundation. Before we deep-dive into the pool of blog niche ideas, let's take a look at some questions you should be asking yourself as you consider the different options.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What are you <span class="bold">passionate</span> about?</li>
      <li>What do you have the most <span class="bold">experience</span> in?</li>
      <li>Is this something that <span class="bold">people are interested</span> in ?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You're most likely starting from a place where you have already considered the first two points. After all, you want to find a blogging niche that doesn't bore you and about which you have a lot of things to write about. The third one, however, will require a bit more external research.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to determine the potential reach of a niche, you'll need to do some keyword research to prove the viability of its topics. Doing so will allow you to determine whether there is enough interest in the content for you to build a successful blog about it. Additionally, you'll be able to see whether you'll be able to monetize your blog through ads, sponsored content or a paywall in the long run.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a blog niche idea can't check off all these requirements, then explore a different one. Even though the passion and experience might be there, it's very hard to stay devoted to something that doesn't reach a significant number of people or make you money.
